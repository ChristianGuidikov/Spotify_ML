# Spotify_ML
Machine Learning and Data Visualisation project based on a large Kaggle dataset featuring information from musical streaming platform Spotify.
The dataset used in this project can be found using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitanshjoshi/spotify-1million-tracks. All the credit for collecting the data goes to the authors of the dataset, and this one is posted under the Open Data Commons licence.

## Part 1
We will first do some visualisation of the data provided and then apply some ML models to try and predict some values.
